       <h3>Q: How long have you been in America so far?</h3>
       <p>This is my fourth year here. I spent one year in Boston when I was a senior in high school.</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: What do you miss the most about your hometown?</h3>
       <p>I miss the street and the food.</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: What camera are you using?</h3>
       <p>I am using a Canon 6D.</p>

       <h3>Q: How long have you been into the photography?</h3>
       <p>I am an amateur photographer. I didnâ€™t take any classes in photography. It is my interest. I start taking pictures since my freshman year in college, so it has been 2 years now. There are so many other photographers taking better images than me so I still have so much more to learn.</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: You took a lot of pictures of your girlfriend. What is the most difficult part of the long-distance relationship?</h3>
       <p>There are so many difficulties to maintain this relationship. It is important to have a sense of security by good communication. When I am not busy, we will video chat every day. We will definitely texting every day even I am in the busiest time of the year.</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: How do you think the negative news of Chinese students?</h3>
       <p>Most of the articles I read connect use with wealth and money, so I often wonder, if we are poor, will media even care about us? Probably the general public will also lose interest reading this article. I think even though China is developing at a very fast speed, it is still unlikely that every family can afford their children to own a fancy car. No matter where they are, good students can always stand out.</p>

       <h3>Q: Do you think the general public have any misunderstanding of Chinese students who study aboard?</h3>
       <p>I think it is mainly focused on we are rich and dumb, which is not true at all.</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: What is the most important value you believe that Chinese students should have?</h3>
       <p>I think it is important for us to understand how much efforts our parents made to send us to study aboard. We should value the environment and the resources we have here.</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: Do you want to go back to China or stay in America?</h3>
       <p>I am going to apply to graduate school. After my master degree, I prefer working in America for a while and then go back to China.</p><br>
