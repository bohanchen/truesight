       <h3>Q: How long have you been in America so far?</h3>
       <p>This is my seventh year in America: 3 years in American high school, 3 years as an undergrad and 1 year in Ph.D.</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: Why do you choose to study your current major?</h3>
       <p>I am majoring in Math. I like math since I was a little kid, and I am really good at it. I was also on the math team when I was in China. I think math is the most objective, beautiful, and pure subject in the world that can motivate my brain.</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: What does it feel like to be a Ph.D. student at the age of an undergrad? Why did you make this decision?</h3>
       <p>I think it is kind of normal to graduate from a math major in three years. Most of the math majors don’t have a master degree, only Ph.D. I got the full scholarship as a math Ph.D. student, so I don’t need to ask moeny from my parents anymore.</p>

       <h3>Q: Do you think the academic abilities of today’s Chinese students are decreasing in the past few years?</h3>
       <p>Most of the Chinese students I believe are very strong in academic works. Although not every student was great when I was in high school, a large percentage of people I knew at RPI are great students.</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: What is the most important value you believe that Chinese students should have?</h3>
       <p>Be yourself, work hard.</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: What do you do when you are free?</h3>
       <p>Playing video games; watching funny and academic videos; reading books</p>

       <h3>Q: What do you miss most from your hometown?</h3>
       <p>I miss my friends and the food.</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: How do you think the negative news of Chinese students?</h3>
       <p>I generally don’t care. I think they are just some special cases.</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: Do you think the general public have any misunderstanding of Chinese students who study aboard?</h3>
       <p>I guess they think we might just be partying every day and the courses are easy. Obviously, this is not true.</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: Do you want to go back to China or stay in America?</h3>
       <p>I want to stay in America as I am going to focus on my academic research in the future.</p>
