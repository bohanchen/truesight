       <h3>Q: How long have you been in America so far?</h3>
       <p>This is my fourth year.</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: Why do you like playing video games?</h3>
       <p>Maybe because I haven’t found a girlfriend so I can only play the video game. Also, there is a difference between playing the video game and doing e-Sports.</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: Do you see a conflict between studying and playing video games?</h3>
       <p>No. You can be a 4.0 student and good gamer at the same time. Gaming also teaches me strategies that I can’t learn from the book.</p>

       <h3>Q: How do you think the news of Internet addiction disorder teens in China?</h3>
       <p>I think the Chinese public is overacting toward this topic. You know, a lot of e-Sports champions are internet addiction students when they are young. In America, this group is called the geek, instead of a mental disease.</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: Besides the game, are you interested in other topics?</h3>
       <p>Besides the game, are you interested in other topics?</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: How do you think the “net red” group?</h3>
       <p>I don’t like people who are showing face, body and wealth online. It is so lame.</p>
       
        <h3>Q: What do you miss the most about your hometown?</h3><p>I miss everything in Nanjing, friends, food, places, family</p>

    <div class = "interview">
       <h3>Q: How do you think the negative news of Chinese students?</h3>
       <p>I think this is the bias from Chinese media. My friends in China admire and respect the experience we have here.</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: Do you think the general public have any misunderstanding of Chinese students who study aboard?</h3>
       <p>I think most of the misunderstand I only found on the Chinese media, but I haven’t seen any bias in Nanjing when I go home.</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: What is the most important value you believe that Chinese students should have?</h3>
       <p>It is very crucial to understand how this world operates.</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: Do you want to go back to China or stay in America?</h3>
       <p>I don’t have a preference on this, but I will definitely continuous studying in America pursuing a Ph.D. degree.</p>
