       <h3>Q: How long have you been in America so far?</h3>
       <p>Three years</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: Why do you choose to study both biology and electronic art?</h3>
       <p>At the beginning, I am trying to get a little away from my lab environment. To be honest, creating art gives me a different mind set. I also want to prove to people who said art is useless and pointless are wrong. It feels great when you can express your emotion through art.</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: What do you miss the most about your hometown?</h3>
       <p>I missed the dialect and the food</p>

       <h3>Q: How do you think the negative news of Chinese students?</h3>
       <p>Most of the report is biased. It is such ironic to see that an increasing number of negative reports of Chinese students resulting an increasing number of students choose to study aboard. Sometimes, it is hard to change others’ mind, so I would just ignore them.</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: Do you think the general public have any misunderstanding of Chinese students who study aboard?</h3>
       <p>I really hate when people said you have to finish such goals and such accomplishments otherwise you are wasting money. Each student is a different individual, so why it sounds we should have the same goal in our life.</p><br>

    <div class = "interview">
       <h3>Q: What is the most important value you believe that Chinese students should have?</h3>
       <p>We need to understand what we want to do in our life. The Chinese student's circle is actually smaller than you think, so it is easier to be misguided by others.</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: Do you want to go back to China or stay in America?</h3>
       <p>I would like to stay a little longer in America. I haven’t figure out what I want to do in the future. Stayhing here gives me more options and opportunities.</p><br>
