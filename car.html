    <div class = "interview">
       <h3>Q: How long have you been in America so far?</h3>
       <p>Three and half year</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: What car do you drive now? How long have you been driving?</h3>
       <p>I have been driving for 4 years. I currently own a 2012 Dodge Charger, </p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: Why do you like American muscle car?</h3>
       <p>I appreciate the pure form of strength and speed of American muscle car</p>

    <div class = "interview">
       <h3>Q: What do you think the difference between American and Chinese drivers?</h3>
       <p>American drivers regard cars as consumable. Generally, they don’t care about what car they drive and prefer to replace it every three or four years. Chinese people see cars as personal assets and prefer long-term holding, like 10 years.</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: Do you think the Chinese students who drive fancy cars are bad students?</h3>
       <p>Not necessarily. I don’t support students buy fancy cars using their parents’ money. If you can get economic independent, like be a successful entrepreneur, it doesn’t matter what you buy and what you wear.</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: How do you think the “net red” group?</h3>
       <p>They are the outcome of the information age. If it keeps generating large profits, it will always exist.</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: How it is different between driving in America and China?</h3>
       <p>I think most American drivers follow the traffic rules. In China, it feels like I am in the hunger games, no rules.</p>

       <h3>Q: What do you miss the most from your hometown?</h3>
       <p>All the cheap staff I can get on Taobao or in the stores.</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: How do you think the negative news of Chinese students?</h3>
       <p>If I states my opinions, I might be in jail. No comments on this.</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: Do you think the general public have any misunderstanding of Chinese students who study aboard?</h3>
       <p>It is overgeneralizing.</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: What is the most important value you believe that Chinese students should have?</h3>
       <p>I think we need to understand what this experience can provide us and know what can we learn from it.</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: Do you want to go back to China or stay in America?</h3>
       <p>Currently, I don't have any preference</p><br>
