       <h3>Q: How long have you been in America so far?</h3>
       <p>Four years</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: How do you think Chinese students’ love values?</h3>
       <p>Generally speaking, it is good. I don’t see it as much a difference between students in America and students in China.</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: Do you think Chinese students’ circle is chaotic?</h3>
       <p>I think at RPI is ok, it might because we are in a small and technical school. Some individuals might have chaotic and promiscuous life, but this kind of situation is everywhere, and not just restricted to Chinese students.</p>

       <h3>Q: What is the most important value in a relationship?</h3>
       <p>It should be properly matched by sharing similar values.</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: How do you think long-distance relationship?</h3>
       <p>I think it is really difficult that requires strong trust and love. It also depends on how far the distance is.</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: What do you miss the most about your hometown</h3>
       <p>Miss the food and my family</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: How do you think the negative news of Chinese students?</h3>
       <p>The media shouldn’t use special cases to cover the entire Chinese students who are studying aboard. A lot of rich kids in China are also a mess. It really depends on the individual.</p>

       <h3>Q: Do you think the general public have any misunderstanding of Chinese students who study aboard?</h3>
       <p>They think we are all very rich, whcih is not true, becaus it is getting easier to studying aboard nowadays.</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: What is the most important value you believe that Chinese students should have?</h3>
       <p>We should focus on study and have a good life.: travel, embrace different experience and cultures. It might be difficult to have the time and opportunity once I go back to China and start working.</p><br>
       
       <h3>Q: Do you want to go back to China or stay in America?</h3>
       <p>I want to go back to China. There are a lot of opportunities in the big cities in China. If I say, I want to live in New York City.</p>
