       <h3>Q: How do you think the negative news of Chinese students?</h3>
       <p>Every group has so-called black sheep. This is inevitable but most of the students here I know are all good. I think the problem here is that the domestic media in China has the trend to just focus on the bad side of the student abroad. But it's undeniable that definitely more good students than bad ones.</p><br>

       <p>No preference for now.</p>
